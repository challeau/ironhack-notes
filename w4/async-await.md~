# DEFINITIONS

> An async function is a function declared with the ```async``` keyword, and the ```await``` keyword is permitted within it.

The ```async``` and ```await``` keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.

Async functions may also be defined as expressions.

# ASYNC

``` javascript
async function name(param0, ..., paramN) {
  statements
}
```

# AWAIT
