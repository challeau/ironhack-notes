# WEB FRAMEWORKS

Web Frameworks or web application frameworks (WAFs) are software frameworks designed to support the development of web applications, including web services, web resources and web APIs.

Unlike libraries that are just a collection of functions and/or classes that you have to call yourself, frameworks are in charge of the flow: they make a call to your code and provide you with some space to write down details.
